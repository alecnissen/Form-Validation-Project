// gameplan 

// use the same set-up as before, 

// check it's input field using conditionals 

// like before with library, 

// ensure each field is properly filled in, 

// look up how to properly create a form 

// adding classes with an error, 

// removing classes/styling when everything is ok with no errors in input 

// apply a background too, with the form contained within a 

// larger container, 

// form in center, 

// email 

// county 

// build the outline, 

// might be a look idea to watch another video on form 

// validation, just to see different methods and to get different 

// perspectives and ideas. 




// whiteboard, 

// build the form, 

// apply a background color to the body 

// have the form be wrapped into a container, 

// style the forms container, 

// add the right input fields, email, country, zip code 

// password and password confirmation fields, 

// live inline validation meaning, that will listen 

// for a change event, or if the user clicks out of the input field, 

// try to make the an input field, and play around with change event 

// I will use a change event listener, listeners for any input, 

// it will highlight red and show error message until requirement is met, 

// all vaidation within a change listener, 

// as well as the submit btn, 

// submit btn will need a listeners too that will basically have the same logic 

// submit btn checks for errors, displays errors and styling 

// as well as change event, highlights red and shows errors 

// until requirement is met
